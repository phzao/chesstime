# chesstime
The purposes of this project is to provide a way to record chess game time.
### The idea:
- Using only the smartphone of the players;
- Let's consider the time of the smartphone to show the real time of the game;
- To start counting time only the emails of both players are needed;
- The timer needs to be synchronized with the two devices;
- In the end, maybe a statistical graph can be shown.
